Feature: As a user I want to be able to add 
    bills to my list from my homepage

        @javascript
        Scenario: The user can add a bill
            When that I am on the homepage
            Then I should see a button called "Add Bill" with css ".add-bill"
            And I should see an "input" called "Bill"
            And I should see an "input" called "Amount"

            Then when I fill in "Bill" with "Electricity" and "Amount" with "20"
            And click the button "Add Bill"
            Then I should see "Electricity Â£20"
