##Housemate: Makers Academy Final Project

###Introduction

Housemate is a bill sharing app for flatmates. It keeps you up to day on who's supposed to pay what. And once they've paid, it tells you how much you owe them - or how much you're owed. You can then settle with them directly through our integrated Paypal connection. 

We're taking caring of those awkward "please pay me" conversations so you don't have to.

###Background

[James](https://github.com/Jrmcneil)'s flatmate is one of those super organised types who keeps a spreadsheet of their bills with a tab for each month. Very practical, kind of ugly, bit of a hassle to keep track of. Plus at the end of the day you have to transfer money via direct debit anyways. We figured that a more intuitive, persistent, web-enabled solution with integrated payments would be something a lot of people would find useful.

###Team

This project was a labor of love from 5 members of the Makers Academy August 2014 cohort: [Nick](https://github.com/Nickrhys), [Leo](https://github.com/leopoldkwok), [James](https://github.com/Jrmcneil), [Andy](https://github.com/Andy010) and [Chris](https://github.com/flickoid)
